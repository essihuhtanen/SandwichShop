# SandwichShop
A project assignment for the Web Development 2 course (University of Tampere, spring 2022).

The aim of the project was to implement a simple web application that imitates the functionality of a sandwich shop: a front end (React) for placing sandwich orders and a back end for processing the order. The entire application is dockerized. 
The back end consists of two servers implemented with Node.js, a MongoDB database and a message queue (RabbitMQ) through which the two servers communicate. 

The project has been carried out with two other students, Melina Aalto-Halme (melina.aalto-halme@tuni.fi) and Teemu Harju (teemu.j.harju@tuni.fi). 

My contribution to the project is mainly on the back end side, implementing partially server A and fully server B.
